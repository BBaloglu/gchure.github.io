I'm a fifth-year biophysics graduate student in the lab of [Rob
Phillips](rpgroup.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](http://caltech.edu) in Pasadena,
CA. I am deeply in love with anything microbial, quantitative, or wrapped in
tortillas and firmly believe that the future of biology relies on an intuition
for the physics that governs it. When not killing billions of bacteria, I'm
either learning new programming languages, exploring the public lands of
California, or [taking photos](/photos.html) of higher organisms.
