description: 
    I’m a sixth-year biophysics graduate student in the lab of Rob Phillips at Caltech in Pasadena, CA. I am deeply in love with anything microbial, quantitative, or wrapped in tortillas. I firmly believe that the future of biology relies on an intuition for the physics that governs it. When not killing billions of bacteria, I’m either learning new programming languages, exploring the public lands of California, or taking photos of higher organisms.
