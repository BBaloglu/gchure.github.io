# Allosteric control in transcriptional regulation

Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack
simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable
parameters of a system to its input-output response. Through use of a
statistical mechanical depiction of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of
allostery, one can derive analytical expressions for the fold-change in gene
expression of a transcriptional regulatory circuit in which the transcription
factor is the allosteric regulator. In [Razo-Mejia and Chure, et al.](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(18)30057-7#.W01_Pgup_pg.twitter), we
put forward such a theory and rigorously test it experimentally in the
context of the most ubiquitous bacterial regulatory architecture - simple
repression.

# Mechanosensation and survival under osmotic shock



Mechanosensitive  (MS)  channels  are  transmembrane  protein  complexes  which  open  and  close  in response to changes in membrane tension as a result of osmotic shock. Despite extensive biophysical characterization, the contribution of these channels to cell survival remains largely unknown. In [Chure, Lee, and Phillips 2018](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/mscl_survival/Chure2018a.pdf)  we use quantitative video microscopy to measure the abundance of a single species of MS channel in single cells followed by their survival after a large osmotic shock.  We observe total death of the population with less than 100 channels per cell and determine that approximately 500 - 700 channels are needed for 80% survival. The number of channels we find to confer nearly full survival is consistent with the counts of the number of channels in wild type cells in several earlier studies.  These results prompt further studies to dissect the contribution of other channel species to survival.

Probability of survival as a function of MscL copy number. (A) Estimated survival probability for survival under slow shock as a function of channel copy number. (B) The estimated survival probability of survival under a fast shock as a function of channel copy number. Solid curves correspond to the most probable survival probability from a one-dimensional logistic regression. Shaded regions represent the 95% credible regions. Points at the top and bottom of plots represent individual cell measurements which survived and perished, respectively. The red and black points correspond to the survival probability estimated via binning by Shine-Dalgarno sequence and binning by groups of 50 channels per cell, respectively. Horizontal error bars represent the standard error of the mean from at least 25 measurements. Vertical error bars represent the certainty of the probability estimate given n survival events from N total observations.
