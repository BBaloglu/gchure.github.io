# Allosteric control in transcriptional regulation

Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack
simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable
parameters of a system to its input-output response. Through use of a
statistical mechanical depiction of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of
allostery, one can derive analytical expressions for the fold-change in gene
expression of a transcriptional regulatory circuit in which the transcription
factor is the allosteric regulator. In [Razo-Mejia and Chure, et al.](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/26/111013), we
put forward such a theory and rigorously test it experimentally in the
context of the most ubiquitous bacterial regulatory architecture - simple
repression.
