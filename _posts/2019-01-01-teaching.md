Teaching has
played an integral role in my development as a scientist. I am interested in
teaching interdisciplinary methods to approach biological questions across all
scales drawing heavily from physics and mathematics as well as from the
computational sciences.

### Computational tutorials for *Bi1 - The Great Ideas of Biology*

[**Basic DNA Sequence Analysis**](http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t01_sequence_analysis.html) \| A tutorial on using DNA sequence to understand the biogeography of Skinks on Fernando de Naronha. [\[data set\]](http://rpdata.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/data/mabuya_atlantica.zip)


[**Euler-Forward Integration**](http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t02_numerical_integration.html) \| This tutorial was used to teach undergraduates how to integrate ordinary differential equations using the Euler-Forward method.


[**Stochastic Simulations**](http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t03_stochastic_simulations.html) \|
A primer on writing stochastic simulations and using them to understand one of the most powerful forces of evolution - genetic drift.


[**Quantitative Image Processing**](http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t04_quantitative_image_processing.html) \| This tutorial covered the basics of quantitative image processing and led students through segmentation of single-celled bacteria to compute the intensity distribution of a YFP reporter gene. [\[data set\]](http://rpdata.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/data/ecoli_images.zip)


[**Chemical Master Equations**](http://bi1.caltech.edu/code/t06_chemical_master_equation.html) \| Chemical master equations are incredibly useful in understanding the "rates and weights" of biological processes. This tutorial teaches the student how to write them and explore their behavior computationally.


### Other Classes At Caltech & Beyond

Below are links to the various courses I have had the privilege to TA.

***Physical Biology Bootcamp*** \[2019, [2018](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/be262/2018), [2017](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/be262/2017/index.html)\]**:** An intensive week-long graduate course which teaches the utility of biological numeracy and its application from theory to experiment.


***Bi1 - The Great Ideas of Biology*** \[[2017](http://bi1.caltech.edu)\]**:** A freshman biology course for non-biology majors which teaches the fundamental principles of modern biology with an emphasis on calculation and quantitative thinking.


***Physical Biology of the Cell*** \[[2018](http://beaph161.caltech.edu/2018/),  [2017](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/gist_pboc_2017), [2016](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/gist_pboc_2016), [2015](http://www.rdata.caltech.edu/courses/CSHL_PBoC_2015)\]**:**
This courses takes a in-depth view at the investigation of biological phenomena using principles from physics. Typical topics of inquiry are dynamics of the cytoskeleton, back-of-the-envelope estimation, genetic regulation, cellular signaling, and evolution. This course is taught all over the world at universities such as [Caltech](http://caltech.edu), [GIST](), and [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://cshl.edu).


***Intro. to Programming in the Biological Sciences*** \[[2016](http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2016/)\]**:** A week long course attended by undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs which teaches the principles of programming and its application to real-life biological problems.


***Data Analysis in the Biological Sciences*** \[[2016](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2016), [2015](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2015)\]**:** This course exposes undergraduates, grad students, and post-docs to practical data analysis using Bayesian inferential methods such as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression. The homework assignments are almost completely open ended and often involve cutting-edge data from Caltech and beyond.


 ***Bi1x - Exploration through Experimentation*** \[[2015](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2015/), [2014](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2014/)\]**:** A course aimed at freshmen undergraduates which teaches the "great ideas of biology" through experimentation. Students perform a variety of experiments including  single-cell microscopy, optogenetics, and DNA sequencing.
